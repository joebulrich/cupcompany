   <p>
     Quite simple, get your favorite ice-cold beverage. Add some ice and pour away!
     But what about my coffee?
     --Don't fret this cup work great for hot and cold beverages!
     Once your done, just throw it on the side of the road. No need to bother with a trash can, or God for bid a recyling bin. That's so early aughts...

       You were clearly born post 1999. Every heard of "Saved by the Bell", "Boys Meets World", or "ER"? Every TV show in the 80's and 90's that had a scene involving a food court or a cafeteria had these cups on display. Now we all kno you definitely don't work in a hospital either, they appartently have the vintage cup supplier on speed dial.
