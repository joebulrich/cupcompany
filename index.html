       Quite simple, get your favorite ice-cold beverage. Add some ice and pour away!
       But what about my coffee?
       --Don't fret this cup work great for hot and cold beverages!
       Once your done, just throw it on the side of the road. No need to bother with a trash can, or God for bid a recyling bin. That's so early aughts...

       <p>
         You were clearly born post 1999. Every heard of "Saved by the Bell", "Boys Meets World", or "ER"? Every TV show in the 80's and 90's that had a scene involving a food court or a cafeteria had these cups on display. Now we all kno you definitely don't work in a hospital either, they appartently have the vintage cup supplier on speed dial.
